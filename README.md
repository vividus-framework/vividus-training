# VIVIDUS Training: Practice Part 3

## Create Composite Steps

1. In your local repo switch to branch "03_task_Composite_Steps" and continue your work in it.

1. Rename the /properties/environment/saucedemo package to the /properties/environment/saucedemo_{yourSurname} (e.g.  "saucedemo_Ivanov"). Then update the environment reference in the configuration.properties file to match the new package name.

1. Meet the following preconditions:

    - Put your scenario into the Task_3.story file.

    - Put all your composite steps into the steps/ui_common.steps file, following the syntax rules.

    - Use the path to the composite steps file that is already set in the root suite.properties file.

1. Create two composite steps to improve your script for the SauceDemo website from Task 2. Here are some guidelines:

    - 4.1 The first composite step should be based on the Homepage_demo.story file and should not require any input parameters. <br />

    - 4.2 The second composite step should handle the login process and be parametrized. <br />

    - 4.3 You can add additional validations according to your preferences. <br />

1. Run the resulting story on your local machine for all the users mentioned in the environment.properties file.

1. Zip the folder that contains the autogenerated Allure Report, and then upload the zipped file to the designated practical task page in the course. Your mentor will review it once you submit all the tasks.

1. Once the task is completed, make sure to commit all your local changes with commit message "{yourSurname}" to your current local branch.
