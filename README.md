# VIVIDUS Training: Practice Part 1

## Tests Execution and Analysis

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and build the project using the instructions provided in Module 4.

1. Import the project into your Eclipse workspace:

    - Go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace.

    - Set the path to the built project and click Finish.

1. Rename the `/properties/environment/saucedemo` package to the `/properties/environment/saucedemo_{yourSurname}` (e.g.  `saucedemo_Ivanov`).

1. Update the environment reference in the `configuration.properties` file to match the new package name from the previous step. Then run tests located in the `/demo` folder on your local machine using the default configuration explained in Module 5.

1. Zip the folder that contains the autogenerated Allure Report, and then upload the zipped file to the designated practical task page in the course. Your mentor will review it once you submit all the tasks.

1. Once the task is completed, make sure to commit all your local changes to your current local branch by executing
    ```sh
    git commit -m {yourSurname}
    ```
    in the command line.
